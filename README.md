# Pop-Pop-Ball
Pop Pop Ball is a game where players click on moving balls to earn points within a time limit. As levels progress, balls become faster and smaller. Randomly appearing boosters provide power-ups or challenges. Players can customize their balls' appearance and compete on a ranking leaderboard.
